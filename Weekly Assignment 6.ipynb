    "The Bag-of-words model can be applied to a text document. After getting rid of stopwords and using lemmitization to reduce the words to the word stem, the words in the document can be counted. It is merely a bag of words because the word order is neglected and words are only counted. The result is a dataframe with the words and their frequency.\n",

By calculating the probability that an item falls into one category or another and multiplying the frequency of the word in these categories, the algorithm can make a calculation predicting what the odds are that a certain word or text falls into one category or another."
